### Application for both producer and customer to organise work easier.

It's basically just my first github basic C++ Windows Console application,</br>
<i>do not take it seriously like something usefull.</i></br></br>
<b>Every from of feedback will be really appreciated.</b></br></br>
Contact me if you want to help my progressing in programming :d  xks777x@gmail.com</br>


### Using application (Alpha v1.1) </br>
1. Choose 'Producer' / 'Customer' mode </br>
2. Use multiple options to managing tasks </br>
3. Remember to write date <b>without</b> '0' character like<i> 09 -> 9 </i>.</br></br>

#### Features
<ul>
<li> Validating Date </li>
<li> Saving data in file </li>
<li> Automatic Task status changing ('Awaiting' -> 'Time is up') </li>
</ul>

Everything is stored in "data.txt" file, which will be created in the same destination as .exe file.
